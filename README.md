# COMP250 FinalProject Multitester

As with the A3 Multitester, the idea here is to bring together a bunch of different tools and testers other people have created.

This Multitester includes:
* huubdejong's MegaTester
* Charlotte Volk's [MyTester](https://github.com/charlottevolk/250-Final-Project-Tester)
   * Expected_Output.rtf also included
* Allison Mazurek's [SearchEngineTest](https://github.com/allisonmazurek/TesterFinalProject_COMP_250)
   * Some print statements added to help with debugging
   * ComputeRankArray() and crawlAndIndexWordIndexUpdated() removed
* myCourses Starter Code, including Minitester
* LI Xiang's [SearchWindow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qYcZ7th0yHrzG74eybkw5kq29Mc5Zc0/view)
   * Updated to crawlAndIndex webpages from multiple testers
* XML files for each tester, including an updated megatest.xml
   * testAcyclic.xml from Minitester
   * test.xml, cs20Links.xml, cs60Links.xml and mcgillWiki.xml from MyTester
   * test1.xmk from SearchEngineTest
   * HoF.xml from SearchWindow
   * megatest.xml from MegaTester, updated to include the webpages from almost all of the above XMLs
   

The main reason I created this Multitester was to be able to use LI Xiang's very cool SearchWindow on a larger "internet," so try that out!

## Installation
Clone as normal in either IntelliJ or Eclipse. Nothing as fancy here as what was in the A3 Multitester.

IntelliJ
1. Click "Get from version control..."
2. Select a local directory and paste the URL of this project

Eclipse
  1. Select "Git -> Projects from Git (with smart import)"
  2. Select "Clone URI"
  3. Paste the URL of this project into "URI"
  4. Select the "master" branch

## Usage
* Replace the SearchEngine.java and Sorting.java placeholders with your own code.
* Run the tester you'd like to use like you would any other file. Again, nothing quite as fancy as in the last Multitester! 
* Start an issue or contact me on Messenger if you have any trouble!

Feel free to start a pull request if you have any updates or tests to add!
