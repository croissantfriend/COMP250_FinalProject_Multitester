# COMP250_FinalProject_Multitester

As with the A3 Multitester, the idea here is to bring together a bunch of different tools and testers other people have created.

This Multitester includes:
* huubdejong's MegaTester
* Charlotte Volk's MyTester
* Allison Mazurek's SearchEngineTest
   * Some print statements added to help with debugging
   * ComputeRankArray() and crawlAndIndexWordIndexUpdated() removed
* myCourses Starter Code, including Minitester
* LI Xiang's SearchWindow
   * Updated to crawlAndIndex webpages from multiple testers
* XML files for each tester, including an updated megatest.xml
   * testAcyclic.xml from Minitester
   * test.xml, cs20Links.xml, cs60Links.xml and mcgillWiki.xml from MyTester
   * test1.xmk from SearchEngineTest
   * HoF.xml from SearchWindow
   * megatest.xml from MegaTester, updated to include the webpages from almost all of the above XMLs
   

The main reason I created this Multitester was to be able to use LI Xiang's very cool SearchWindow on a larger "internet," so try that out!

## Installation
* Clone as normal in either IntelliJ or Eclipse. Nothing as fancy here as what was in the A3 Multitester.

Eclipse
  1. Select "Git -> Projects from Git (with smart import)"
  2. Select "Clone URI"
  3. Paste the URL of this project into "URI"
  4. Select the "master" branch

## Usage
Each file can be run on its own as normal. Start an issue or contact me on Messenger if you have any trouble!

## Contributing
